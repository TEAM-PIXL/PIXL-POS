# Project Brief: Restaurant Management Application

This project aims to develop a Restaurant Management Application designed to enhance the operations 
of small to medium-sized restaurants in Brisbane. The goal is to provide an affordable alternative 
to expensive proprietary POS (Point of Sale) systems by covering essential aspects of restaurant 
management. The application will offer essential features to meet the needs of restaurant staff, 
including waiters, cooks, and administrators, such as order taking, kitchen workflow management, and
administrative control for business owners.


## Project Relevance

### Technological Advancements
The restaurant industry is increasingly adopting digital solutions like self-service kiosks, mobile 
ordering and contactless payments. Implementing an ordering system for waiters and cooks will allow 
restaurants to keep up with these advancements, streamline operations, reduce wait times, and enhance 
the overall dining experience.

### Cost Efficiency
Many small Brisbane restaurants face financial pressure due to rising operational costs. Traditional
POS systems are often expensive, making it hard for these businesses to adopt advanced solutions.
Offering a more affordable and scalable alternative helps small restaurants lower both initial and
ongoing costs, making it easier to access technology that improves operations, order accuracy, and
overall efficiency.

### Tourism Growth
With the Brisbane Olympics in 2032, the influx of tourists will increase demand for efficient
restaurant management systems. An advanced POS system will help local restaurants manage higher
customer volumes and ensure a smooth dining experience.

### Small Business Support
Small independent restaurants often struggle against larger chains that have more resources. By
providing an affordable and accessible management solution, this project supports local restaurants,
helping them thrive in a competitive market.
